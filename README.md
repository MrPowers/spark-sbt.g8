# spark-sbt.g8

A [Giter8](https://github.com/foundweekends/giter8) template for Spark SBT applications.

## Usage

1. Install SBT with Homebrew (`brew install sbt`) or with SDKMAN [which is a better option](https://mungingdata.com/java/sdkman-multiple-versions-java-sbt-scala/)

2. Start the app generation wizard: `sbt new MrPowers/spark-sbt.g8`

3. Fill out the project properties on the command line

4. Run the tests to make sure the project was generated correctly.  `cd` into the top level project directory and then run `sbt test`.
